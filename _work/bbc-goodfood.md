Over a 15-month-long period, TMW collaborated with BBC Worldwide with the objective to re-structure, re-design and rebuild the BBC Good Food website – the UK’s biggest food site, with an average of 8 million unique users and approximately 45 million views per month.

Leading the User Experience and Front-End aspects of the project, we helped deliver BBC Worldwide’s first fully responsive website, including the best of BBC Good Food's existing catalogue of content.
