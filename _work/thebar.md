theBar.com is a popular US cocktail resource; my team and I created the Western Europe version of this already popular site, specifically the UK version. 

From UX to performance, every aspect of the site was improved and carefully considered. I created a special asset font for the site, this creates crisp, hiDpi friendly icons that look great at any resolution.

A German version of the site came later which presented some unique design challenges, not least of which is the fact that German words are approximately 1.5 times the length of English words.The site is now live at [de.thebar.com](http://de.thebar.com).
