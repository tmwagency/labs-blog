## [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for the [Kickoff framework](https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/)
###The generator asks for:
* The project's name
* The names of the project's developers
* The javascript namespace you would like to use (default is `KO`)
* If you'd like to use [Statix](/kickoff/statix/)
* Which javascript libraries to install. jQuery v1x/2x, Trak.js, Swiftclick & Cookies are the options
* If you'd like to use Browserify (available soon)
