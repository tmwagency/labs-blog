#Useful Tools for Web Design

Today, web design is not just about being able to read and write code; exciting new tools are available to help designers and developers simplify the process of making websites. This post is a just a compilation of some of the tools we use day-to-day at TMW, which – when creating your future projects – will hopefully become as useful to you as they have done for us.


##Froont – no more coding required

There are many paid-for services available to help you create a website without the need to be a code ninja. Froont is slightly different as, although it offers a 15 day trial period, within this time it allows you to not only design responsive websites directly in the browser with a simple drag and drop interface, but also to download the (relatively clean) generated source code. This effectively means that you’ll be able to upload the source code your own hosting environment. The main downside to this platform is the limited set of animation tools.
