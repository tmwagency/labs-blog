You spend three years at university or go to college and graduate or finish, then what? Time to hit the big bad world. It’s not always a walk in the park.
I was fortunate enough to land an internship at TMW and what a year it has been.

It can be quite intimidating the first time walking into a professional business setting, but there is no need to stress over anything. Most of the people working in the office started in a similar position when they first entered the profession and so are generally used to dealing with the arrival of an intern.

Originally, I was provided with a schedule of activities for each of the various departments I would sit with, but not everything can be planned and after a week or so it was decided that we just go with the flow, with me helping out in different areas where needed.

At first I worked within the content management team, in which I would manage content for different websites. As simple as it seemed, it required a lot more effort than I had initially realised. The main challenge was learning to use a number of different CMS platforms effectively.

Soon after that, I was moved to the QA (quality assurance) department. The QA team are in charge of spotting mistakes or defects in web page, website, web-app and email builds in order to ensure the user experience is as expected across all targeted platforms and devices.

As an intern, there are days where there are lots of things to do, but it is a possibility that assignments will not be constantly coming in. There may be times when you have completed all required tasks and are awaiting further briefs, and sometimes it is also necessary to wait for other departments to finish their tasks before you can start your own, which was definitely the case when working with the Content and QA teams.

Moving on into the email department, I found myself doing something that I was more used to, considering my background in development, yet with a twist; I had always been used to building web pages and websites with layouts based on `<div>` tags, but building emails usually required table-based layouts entirely.

At first, kicking the habit of using `<div>` tags was a bit of a problem. Reason being, they worked on screen but they also had to work on mobiles and not just one mobile at that. For anyone starting anew, this could be daunting but having colleagues that are more than willing to help and train you in the workflow that they practise helps you get to grips and even develop your own workflow.

I spent a lot of time with the email team. Christmas was approaching and unsurprisingly, every client had promotional Christmas emails to be sent out before the holiday season, so there was always a high demand for the extra pair of hands.
Soon after was the gradual transition into front-end development.

Front-end was a whole new world entirely. There were things I knew were possible, but I soon realised the limitations of my knowledge in this area. Understandably, most large projects weren’t offered to me right away, but I was involved with some of the more straightforward builds, although even some of these had their ups and downs. Most specifically the Facebook applications.

Some of our clients use a platform named Buddy Media – something I had never heard of before – to create Facebook Tab applications. Stating that the platform isn’t exactly developer-friendly would be an understatement but, through its challenges and with a lot of help, I got to grips with it and also learnt a lot about the jQuery library along the way.

Due to the fast-paced nature of the development lifecycle, finding a regular time when members of the front-end team can step away from their work is tricky, especially when emergencies arise. That being said, self-development is vital and so, even when busy, members of the team try to make time for me and answer some of my questions.

I’ve come to learn a lot of jQuery throughout this year. So much so that I am now able to take on a lot more project responsibility without much help. I’m starting with the simple things, of course, but I have no doubt that eventually, I’ll be a pro!
