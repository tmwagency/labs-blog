You spend three years at university or go to college and graduate or finish, then what? Time to hit the big bad world. It’s not always a walk in the park.
I was fortunate enough to land an internship at TMW and what a year it has been.

It can be quite intimidating the first time walking into a professional business setting, but there is no need to stress over anything.  The people working in the office started in your shoes when they first entered the work field and will be well informed about the arrival of an intern.

Originally there was a schedule in place of which departments I would sit with and what I’d be doing but not everything goes to plan. The schedule definitely didn’t. After a week or so it was decided that we just go with the flow and help out in different areas where needed.

At first I worked within the content management team in which I would manage content for different sites. As simple as it seemed, it required more than I thought. The main challenge was having to learn and be able to use different CMS platforms.

Soon after I was moved to quality assurance (QA). The QA team was in charge of spotting mistakes or defects in site or page builds in order to enhance the user experience.

As an intern it is a possibility that the work you are assigned will not be constantly coming in.  There may be times when you have no new assignments, and have completed all previous assignments. This was definitely the case whilst working in content and QA. Updates don’t always come in every day for sites and Rome wasn’t built in a day, hardly any sites are either.
There are days where there are lots of things to do and others where you’re waiting for other departments to finish their tasks before it can get to you.

Moving on into the email department, I found myself doing something I was more used to in development yet with a twist. I had always been used to building pages and sites using division tags or <div>’s, yet building emails were usually entirely built using tables.

At first, kicking the habit of using <div>’s was a bit of a problem. Reason being, they worked on screen but they also had to work on mobiles and not just one mobile at that. For anyone starting anew, this could be daunting but having colleagues that are more than willing to help and train you in the workflow that they practise helps you get to grips and even develop your own workflow.

I spent a lot of time with the email team. Christmas was coming up and unsurprisingly, every client had Christmas promotion emails to be sent out before the holidays meaning there was always a high demand for the extra pair of hands.
Soon after was the gradual transition into front-end development.

Frontend was a whole new world entirely. There were things I knew were possible but I soon realised how little I knew about anything front-end. Understandably, most large projects weren’t offered to me to get my hands into but for the few big projects I was involved with had their ups and downs.
Most specifically Comfort.

Comfort’s facebook applications were built using a platform named Buddymedia. A system not widely liked by quite a few developers and something I had never heard of before. Through its challenges, it was published and with a lot of help, especially with the JQuery side of things.

Due to the nature of development, finding a regular time when members of the development team can step away from their work is tricky especially when emergencies arise, both personal and work related.
That being said, self-development is vital and there’s always someone available to help.

I’ve come to learn a lot of JQuery throughout this year. So much so, I can do things with without much help. Simple things of course but I have no doubt eventually, I’ll be a pro!
