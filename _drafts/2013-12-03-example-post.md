And this is where you write your post.

Titles are easy peasy

## sub titles
### sub titles

- - -

Lists are simples

* Apples
* Oranges
* Pears

- - -

Or numbered lists

1. Important point
2. Important point
3. Not so important point

- - -

And [writing links](http://labs.tmw.co.uk), making text **bold** or *italic* is also mega easy.

- - -

Horizontal rules are pretty simple too.

- - -

If you need inline code samples `no problem!`

- - -

```
Or for larger code blocks are god too sometimes

function () {
}
```

- - -

<p class="my-class">And if you want to forget it all and just write plain old <strong>HTML</strong> you can do that too</p>
