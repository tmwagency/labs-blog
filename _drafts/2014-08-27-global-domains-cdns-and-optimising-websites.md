title: "Geotargeting considerations for website hosting"

Search engines will weight search results in favour of websites that are local to the users. I have recently looked into the factors that affect these localised search results. What I have learnt is that search engines are constantly changing the way they apply weighting to maximise relevance of results to the user, so what is valid now may be different in 6 months.

Currently the factors that affect localised search results and that you should take into consideration are the following:

### Domain
If your website is targeting a specific country then the best option is to use a country coded top level domain (ccTLD). This would be domains like mysite.co.uk, mysite.de etc. If you have to use a global top level domain (gTLD) but you are targeting a specific country then you should use webmaster tools to indicate the geographic location that your website is targeting. In fact regardless of what type of domain you use, you should use webmaster tools indicate targeted region.

If your domain strategy requires you to target multiple countries within the same gTLD then using separate sub domains for each geographic location you are targeting also helps e.g. uk.mysite.com.

### Hosting location
Search is evolving very fast. Although the location of servers used to be considered as an important ranking factor this has begun to change with the emergence of cloud hosting and CDNs. This is why whilst ideally you still want to have the site hosted locally, Google have recognised that this not always possible and have recently (October 2013) confirmed that “For search, specifically for geotargeting, the server's location plays a very small role, in many cases it's irrelevant. If you use a ccTLD or a gTLD together with Webmaster Tools, then we'll mainly use the geotargeting from there, regardless of where your server is located. You definitely don't need to host your website in any specific geographic location -- use what works best for you, and give us that information via a ccTLD or Webmaster Tools.” (John Mueller - Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google) https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/webmasters/k6po9mnpI8c/discussion.


### Content and tagging
Your website content should be relevant to the local you are targeting, this includes website language, content and tagging.
