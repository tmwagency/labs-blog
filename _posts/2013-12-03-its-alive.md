After far too long thinking about putting together a dedicated TMW labs blog, we’ve finally put up our very own MVP.

The aim of this blog is to have somewhere that the creative tech team at TMW can talk more openly about the design and tech behind the projects and sites we’re working on; the main TMW blog didn’t seem like the best place to talk about serious tech.  It also gives us somewhere to discuss how we work and what we learn in the process.

## What next…

We have lots of ideas around how we’d like the site to grow, but that’s for the future; for now we’re aiming to post regular updates from across the team and let the rest follow.

We also now have a [TMW Labs](https://twitter.com/tmw_labs) Twitter account, so if anyone wants to get in touch with us directly, we’re all ears.

So that’s it really - the difficult first post.  To celebrate, here’s a dog gif...
