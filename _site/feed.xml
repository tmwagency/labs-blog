				<title>A designers adventures in game development: part 1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&#39;ve had an interest in programming starting with Flash, a few years ago though I made the seemingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/&quot;&gt;obvious choice&lt;/a&gt; to start moving on from Actionscript to focus on Javascript. I find that the best way to learn is by doing, so since the start of the summer I started creating a little responsive HTML and Javascript game. This and subsequent posts will document my process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s working title is &lt;strong&gt;‘Bitmap Adventure’&lt;/strong&gt; with the story revolving around a huge villain, in the form of a block-like Monkey, kidnapping a Goat’s child. Rescuing the child and defeating the villain is your main challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle system uses Paper, Scissors, Stone (otherwise known as Janken). The visualisation of these battles uses some some basic pixel animation with cute, simple versions of the warriors. To introduce players to the battle system I decided to feature a battle in the intro itself, where you attempt to battle the villain straight away, but with battle inexperience so early on in the game you’ll lose; its all part of the intro. I’m still working on how a levelling / experience feature will work within the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing the intro helped to get my head around how the game would work on different devices from the start. I started off with a 320px wide photoshop document when I was creating a look and feel for the game, figuring out the mobile look and size first. The reason behind this is the game could get complex so its easier to add than take away from the intended design. There were many cases of developing prototypes and designing at the same time, to ensure it looked great across all devices. With such a simple graphical style, it&#39;s a little easier to add filler for wider screen formats. Supporting Retina devices couldn’t be easier with this, as all the original sprites just needed to be resized to 200% with Nearest Neighbour image resampling to preserve the hard pixel edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/adventures-in-game-dev/post1-b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Positioning elements&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is still in the early stages, with the intro 90% complete, and the game area coming along nicely in both design and development. All the levels, weather parameters and portal positions are all managed through settings in a JSON file, which makes it easier to manage and update when needed. Levels are designed in Photoshop using tiles fitting to a 40px x 40px grid, which are then positioned in the game converting the JSON data into CSS positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/adventures-in-game-dev/post1-a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Positioning elements&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portals have been the biggest Javascript headache so far. There were a number of cases where the character would enter the portal and then not reappear through the next, showing no Javascript errors. Exiting the portal seemed to work differently on Chrome and Safari at times too; the current fix is to give Chrome a slight delay when the level reloads to fix the error.  This seems to be simply due to differences in rendering engines across different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Javascript being more strict than Actionscript, I’m finding that I have to change my coding approach to solve certain problems; its all part of learning. Of course I could have built this in Flash, but I wanted the game to work on mobile devices and writing it in JavaScript helps me learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a prototype of the intro and entering the game area at &lt;a href=&quot;http://simonkinslow.com/_2013/bitmap_prototype/part1/&quot;&gt;simonkinslow.com/_2013/bitmap_prototype/part1/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: On touch devices use the weird black crab to control the character. On desktop use the arrow keys, and ideally use Chrome or Safari.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Really Good Hyperlinks #1 - Dec 11th</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first of a regular weekly labs@tmw post, that we&#39;ve inventively called &#39;Really Good Hyperlinks&#39;, where we attempt to filter out some of the finest links we&#39;ve seen over the past week on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let&#39;s get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Demos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aerotwist.com/lab/poly-maker/&quot;&gt;PolyMaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of redesigning his website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aerotwist&quot;&gt;Paul Lewis&lt;/a&gt; has released this great canvas demo in which the user can generate their very own 3D shape by plotting 4 points on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://roboboogie.codeclub.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Robo-boogie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice your dance moves before hitting the town with this demo from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeclub.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Code Club&lt;/a&gt;, with which you can alter the angle and speed of animations performed by a dancing robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://david.li/waves/&quot;&gt;Waves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice calming 3D wave demo to help reduce those Tuesday stresses.  Created using WebGL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Articles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rupl.github.io/unfold/&quot;&gt;Unfolding the Box Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really awesome interactive guide to CSS 3D transforms, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rupl&quot;&gt;Chris Ruppel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oak.is/thinking/animated-svgs/&quot;&gt;Animated SVGs: custom easing and timing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to animate a chart without the overhead of adding a large JS library to your site?  Well this post, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mfortress&quot;&gt;Mike Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, takes us through exactly how to do so using animated SVGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/design-ux/bea05243fe3&quot;&gt;Understanding Easing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of easing in animations by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SureshVSelvaraj&quot;&gt;Suresh V. Selvaraj&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://martineau.tv/blog/2013/12/more-efficient-grunt-workflows/&quot;&gt;More efficient Grunt workflows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some essential Grunt.js tips from our very own &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/MrMartineau&quot;&gt;Zander Martineau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sites and services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://import.io/&quot;&gt;Import.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free service that helps turn any website into an API, allowing streaming or RESTful queries. This could be useful when used in combination with technologies like NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robindavey.co.uk/&quot;&gt;RobinDavey.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever on the lookout for quirky animations, Robin Davey&#39;s site, showing some of his work, has some beautiful examples.  Good creative inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TMW links worth mentioning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.free-ride.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Free Ride&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little hack-project we&#39;ve been running at TMW, in which we track a bike around London by hooking it up with a GPRS tracker, and then leaving it on the streets to see where it goes.  We&#39;ll be doing a write-up on the tech behind the project shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lynxafrica18.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Lynx Africa Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the 18th birthday for Lynx Africa, we asked 18 artists and musicians to produce work for a responsive Tumblr blog.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Introducing Kickoff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Within a large team, making sure that everyone is on the same page can be difficult; at TMW we have a team of about 20 web developers (6 are front-enders and creative technologists) and this was an issue that we needed to tackle. We create many different types of sites, from single page apps to large-scale builds like &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.thebar.com&quot;&gt;uk.thebar.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbcgoodfood.com&quot;&gt;BBC Goodfood&lt;/a&gt; and needed a framework that would work for all of them, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/AshNolan_&quot;&gt;Ash Nolan&lt;/a&gt; and I created &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/&quot;&gt;Kickoff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kickoff is a lightweight front-end framework for creating scalable, responsive sites&lt;/strong&gt;; that might sound a bit vague but it is the essence of the framework. Due to the nature of agency work, the projects are hugely varied, but as developers, we always try to cut corners to normalise things as much as possible – basically because we&#39;re lazy and we don&#39;t want to have to repeat things very often! Kickoff aims to mitigate common problems found in web development by providing a strong starting point and a set of helpful defaults for use on almost any project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference of Kickoff when compared with other similar frameworks – I&#39;m looking at you &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;foundation.zurb.com&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; – is that it is not nearly as prescriptive. While those frameworks define almost every aspect of a website with CSS styles and JavaScript plugins that do everything, Kickoff has most of that but does not enable it by default. For example, we have a simple grid system, but if you need something more complex or, heaven forbid, not use one, that is not a problem; just don&#39;t include it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The tech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com&quot;&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; is used extensively in Kickoff. It is the beating heart of the framework, we use it to compile our &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt;, concatinate and then minify our JavaScript files, or to fire up a simple local server with LiveReload for some testing. Using Grunt has other benefits besides this; it allows any dev to pick up a project, regardless of if they&#39;ve worked on it before, and get up and running in no time at all. We are working on getting Grunt set-up on our Teamcity continuous integration build server but it is not ready yet - this will be a massive step forward once that&#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do you get your hands on it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have built a brochure site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/&quot;&gt;tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/&lt;/a&gt; where you can find documentation and demos on various parts of the framework. If you want to grab the code, visit our Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/&quot;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt;. It is being actively maintained and we welcome suggestions and support for improvements. If you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io&quot;&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/docs/yeoman.html&quot;&gt;Kickoff generator&lt;/a&gt; that I created to help speed up the project creation process even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few sites using Kickoff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbcgoodfood.com&quot;&gt;BBC Goodfood&lt;/a&gt; cookery site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Western Europe version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.thebar.com&quot;&gt;uk.thebar.com&lt;/a&gt; cocktail site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://strepsils.co.uk/xfactor&quot;&gt;Strepsils Xfactor&lt;/a&gt; competition site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.tmw.co.uk&quot;&gt;labs.tmw.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; - Woop Woop!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are very proud of Kickoff, it has helped our team become more efficient, improving workflow throughout the department. Just give it a try on your projects and let us know how you get on.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It’s alive!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After far too long thinking about putting together a dedicated TMW labs blog, we’ve finally put up our very own MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this blog is to have somewhere that the creative tech team at TMW can talk more openly about the design and tech behind the projects and sites we’re working on; the main TMW blog didn’t seem like the best place to talk about serious tech.  It also gives us somewhere to discuss how we work and what we learn in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What next…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lots of ideas around how we’d like the site to grow, but that’s for the future; for now we’re aiming to post regular updates from across the team and let the rest follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also now have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmw_labs&quot;&gt;TMW Labs&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, so if anyone wants to get in touch with us directly, we’re all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s it really - the difficult first post.  To celebrate, here’s a dog gif...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dog.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dog going nuts over an exercise ball&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
